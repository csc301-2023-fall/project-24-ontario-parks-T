# Group 24 Deliverable 2 Group Report

### Summary of software

Our product is an Audio QR Management Solution - an audio system for park guides and its management system based on QR code distribution. We are partnering with John Leadston, a Resident Business Analyst at the Ontario Cabinet Office who has worked with Ontario Park for a long time.

There was previously another implementation of a similar problem done by Michele Massa and her team, who was taking CSC301, with the same partner, John Leadston. This project is similar to ours, because it is also a system that allows park visitors to access audios by QR code and managers to manage the audio resources. Some parts of our project may reference this previous implementation.

### How we divide the project

We decided to implement the software as a web app, which allows park visitors to have access to the audio most conveniently. We decided to divide the projectâ€™s development to three parts: frontend, backend, and database.

We decided to divide the project in this way because these are the most basic components of a web app. Also, our group consists of members with different knowledge, skills, and capabilities. We have exactly two people capable for each of the three subjects.

### Responsibility of each subgroup

Frontend: responsible for all the front-end development. Decides the layout of UI, and need to develop two frontends. One to play the audio for the park visitors, and one for the park managers, allowing them to add, delete, edit, and manage the audios and QR code.

Backend: responsible for all the back-end development. Create server programs that handles the requests from frontends, and retrieve data from the database.

Database: responsible for all the database development. Create a database that ensures all data are stored and related correctly and can be retrieved by the backend.
