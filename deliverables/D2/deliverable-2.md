# Group 24 Deliverable 2 Group Report

### Summary of software

Our product is an Audio QR Management Solution - an audio system for park guides and its management system based on QR code distribution. We are partnering with John Leadston, a Resident Business Analyst at the Ontario Cabinet Office who has worked with Ontario Park for a long time.

Although there was previously another implementation of a similar project done by Michele Massa and her team, who was taking CSC301, with the same partner, John Leadston, and some parts of our project may reference this previous implementation, We are rebuilding the project for a more expandable solution, and fits different user stories.

### How we divide the project

We decided to implement the software as a web app, which allows park visitors to have access to the audio most conveniently. We decided to divide the projectâ€™s development to three parts: frontend, backend, and database.

We decided to divide the project in this way because these are the most basic components of a web app. Also, our group consists of members with different knowledge, skills, and capabilities. We have exactly two people capable for each of the three subjects.
