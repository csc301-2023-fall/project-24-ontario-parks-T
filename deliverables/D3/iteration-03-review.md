> 
>  * Ordered from most to least important, with supporting argument explaining a change.

#### Q3(b). Integration & Next steps
> Briefly explain how you integrated the previously developed individuals components as one product (i.e. How did you be combine the code from 3 sub-repos previously created) and if/how the assignment was helpful or not helpful.
> 
>  * Keep this very short (1-3 lines).

We integraed the previously developed individual components as one product by pulling the code from our subteam repos, and then pushing them all to the main repo. Then, we together decided on how should the backend process the requests from the frontend, and how the frontend should present the backend. D2 is helpful in terms of helping us separate our jobs and make clear the structure of our product.


## Product - Review

#### Q4. How was your product demo?
>  * How did you prepare your demo?
>  * What did you manage to demo to your partner?
>  * Did your partner accept the features? And were there change requests?
>  * What were your learnings through this process? This can be either from a process and/or product perspective.
>  * *This section will be marked very leniently so keep it brief and just make sure the points are addressed*

We prepared our demo by setting up the running environment in the developer's device, and made a demo to our partner through our zoom meeting. Our partner, Mr. Leadston, accepted most of the features. He mainly asked us to increase the usability of the admin UI. Also, we are requested to increase the usability and accessibility of our visitor's interface. We learned that there are a great amount of details that we need to improve for the accessibility of people with various difficulties.
