# Team 24 Room Three


## Iteration 01 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: 2023 Nov 18, 14:00 
 * Where: University of Toronto, BA2230

## Process - Reflection

#### What worked well

<!---
List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions and actions that worked well.

 * 2 - 4 important decisions, processes, actions, or anything else that worked well for you, ordered from most to least important.
 * Give a supporting argument about what makes you think that way.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).
-->

* In the later half of the deliverable, we changed our git workflow from centralized to feature branching. This saved us from the danger of having our repository broken because of some members' careless push and helped our pull history look more managed. Also, we could see the features implemented from the pull request history in this way.

* We changed our team member's responsibilities. In the last deliverable, we are divided into subgroups. However, in this deliverable, we decided it would be better to assign more people to the frontend and leave nobody responsible for only the database. This change made us put more working hours into the part with more work to be done.

#### What did not work well

<!---
List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions and actions that did not work well.

 * 2 - 4 important decisions, processes, actions, or anything else that did not work well for you, ordered from most to least important.
 * Give a supporting argument about what makes you think that way.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).
-->

* In the first half of the deliverable, we used a centralized workflow, in which all our team members pull from and push into the main branch. This provided convenience, as we did not need to navigate through pull requests and multiple branches, making our repository vulnerable. One careless push to the main branch might break the repository and create tremendous work to fix it.

* Initially, we separated our team into three equal-sized subteams, like in deliverable 2. However, this strategy soon turned out to work poorly. Each team member has different technical capabilities, and each task has a different amount of work. Especially for the database, as there was little left in the database to be done after we finished deliverable 2. Some of our members do not know how to do the assigned work, and some front-end work piled up, and no one was scheduled to complete them. So, we changed this team-division strategy later on.

#### Planned changes

<!---
List any **process-related** (i.e. team organization and/or how you work) changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

 * Ordered from most to least important, with supporting argument explaining a change.
-->

* We are planning to put more repository protections and branch rules to protect our repository and regulate the workflow. We believe that this can make our work more organized and less vulnerable.

#### Integration & Next steps

<!---
Briefly explain how you integrated the previously developed individuals components as one product (i.e. How did you be combine the code from 3 sub-repos previously created) and if/how the assignment was helpful or not helpful.
 * Keep this very short (1-3 lines).
-->

We integrated the previously developed individual components as one product by pulling the code from our subteam repos and then pushing them all to the main repo. Then, we decided on how the backend should process the requests from the frontend and how the frontend should present the backend. D2 is helpful in terms of helping us separate our jobs and make clear the structure of our product.


## Product Demo

<!---
 * How did you prepare your demo?
 * What did you manage to demo to your partner?
 * Did your partner accept the features? And were there change requests?
 * What were your learnings through this process? This can be either from a process and/or product perspective.
 * *This section will be marked very leniently so keep it brief and just make sure the points are addressed*
-->

We prepared our demo by setting up the running environment in the developer's device and made a demo to our partner through our Zoom meeting. Our partner, Mr. Leadston, accepted most of the features. He mainly asked us to increase the usability of the admin UI. Also, we are requested to increase the usability and accessibility of our visitor's interface. We learned that there are a great amount of details that we need to improve for the accessibility of people with various difficulties.
