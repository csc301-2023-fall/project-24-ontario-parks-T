# AudioQR Management Solution /Room Three
​
> _Note:_ This document is intended to be relatively short. Be concise and precise. Assume the reader has no prior knowledge of your application and is non-technical. 
​
## Partner Intro
 * Partner: Our partner is John Leadston, Resident Business Analyst at the Ontario Cabinet Office 
 * His email is john.leadston2@ontario.ca.
 * John is our primary contact.
 * He has worked with Ontario Park for a long time.
 * The Cabinet Office is a ministry of the Government of Ontario. Its role is to serve as the Premier's ministry, and as such, its employees are not political appointees, but are permanent members of the Ontario public service.



## Description about the project
 * Our product is an AudioQR Management Solution - an audio system for park guides and its management system based on QR code distribution.
 * Our product may replace some physical information boards at the park, which are expensive and manpower-consuming to maintain and update, and are not friendly for people who are visually impaired. Also, sometimes people would need to line up in front of information desks for simple questions. Our product is expected to increase the accessibility of guiding information at parks and to allow more cost-efficient and easier management for administrators.

## Instructions
 * Clear instructions for how to use the application from the end-user's perspective
 * How do you access it? For example: Are accounts pre-created or does a user register? Where do you start? etc. 
 * Provide clear steps for using each feature described in the previous section.
 * This section is critical to testing your application and must be done carefully and thoughtfully.
 
 ## Development requirements
 * What are the technical requirements for a developer to set up on their machine or server (e.g. OS, libraries, etc.)?
     * Currently, we have not decided on every technical requirements we might need. For D1, we can only say that we will need some libraries including Django, REACT, and CSS templates like Bulma or Bootstrap. We might also need our members to download and set up Postman, in order to test the applications. But again this is only D1, we have not really started any actual implementations, so this part is expected change as our project goes on.
 * Briefly describe instructions for setting up and running the application. You should address this part like how one would expect a README doc of real-world deployed application would be.
 * You can see this [example](https://github.com/alichtman/shallow-backup#readme) to get started.
 
 ## Deployment and Github Workflow
​
Describe your Git/GitHub workflow. Essentially, we want to understand how your team members share codebase, avoid conflicts and deploys the application.
​
 * Be concise, yet precise. For example, "we use pull-requests" is not a precise statement since it leaves too many open questions - Pull-requests from where to where? Who reviews the pull-requests? Who is responsible for merging them? etc.
 * If applicable, specify any naming conventions or standards you decide to adopt.
 * Describe your overall deployment process from writing code to viewing a live application
 * What deployment tool(s) are you using? And how?
 * Don't forget to **briefly justify why** you chose this workflow or particular aspects of it!

 ## Coding Standards and Guidelines
 Keep this section brief, a maximum of 2-3 lines. You would want to read through this [article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/coding-standards-and-guidelines/) to get more context about what this section is for before attempting to answer.
  * These are 2 optional resources that you might want to go through: [article with High level explanation](https://blog.codacy.com/coding-standards-what-are-they-and-why-do-you-need-them/) and [this article with Detailed Explanation](https://google.github.io/styleguide/)

 ## Licenses 
​
 Keep this section as brief as possible. You may read this [Github article](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/licensing-a-repository) for a start.
​
 * What type of license will you apply to your codebase? And why?
 * What affect does it have on the development and use of your codebase?
